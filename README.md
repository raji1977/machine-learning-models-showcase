# Machine Learning Models Showcase

This repository consolidates core machine learning models and data analysis techniques into a single, professional portfolio. It includes **regression**, **classification**, and **statistical analysis** projects with clear explanations, visualizations, and practical applications.

## Contents

The repository currently contains 7 notebooks demonstrating key ML concepts:

### Regression
- `linear-regression.ipynb` – Linear regression implementation and evaluation.

### Classification
- `logistic-regression-classification.ipynb` – Logistic regression and Naive Bayes on the Iris dataset.
- `svm-xgboost-classification.ipynb` – Support Vector Machine and XGBoost models.
- `decision-tree-random-forest.ipynb` – Decision Tree and Random Forest models on the Heart Disease dataset.

### Statistical Analysis
- `statistical-tests.ipynb` – t-test and ANOVA examples.
- `eda-visualization.ipynb` – Exploratory Data Analysis and visualization techniques.
- `data-summary-correlation.ipynb` – Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis.

> **Note:** `Ridge_and_Lasso_regression` will be added to the regression folder later.
